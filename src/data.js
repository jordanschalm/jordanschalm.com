          auction system of the final product and helped make our ownership

          our development processes to get new members building cool stuff
          faster. Members develop their engineering and design skills by building 
          projects from conception to release in small, focussed teams. We also
          host workshops for the broader UBC tech community focussed on
          technical topics and career development.`,
