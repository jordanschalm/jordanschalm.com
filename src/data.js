Flow is a fast, secure, and developer-friendly blockchain built to support the next generation of games, apps, and digital assets.
It pioneered many breakthroughs in decentralized technology, including: 

- Separating consensus from compute to achieve high performance without compromising global state atomicity.
- [Cadence](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/index), the most ergonomic and safe-by-default programming language available for smart contract development.
- Accounts with error-resistant addresses, built-in smart contracts, and multi-sig.

I have worked on Flow through 3 code-names and 4 years, starting in 2019.
Some of my notable contributions are the [Jolteon consensus algorithm](https://flow.com/engineering-blogs/jolteon-advancing-flows-consensus-algorithm), 
the distributed key generation protocol, the Collection Node, and the automated node operator selection system.`,
